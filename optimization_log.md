# CIFAR100 Wide ResNet Optimization Log

## Baseline Results (2024-11-26)
- Architecture: Wide ResNet-28-10
- Best Test Accuracy: 57.10% (Epoch 20)
- Training Accuracy: 74.93%
- Configuration:
  - Batch size: 128
  - Initial LR: 0.1
  - Optimizer: SGD with momentum (0.9)
  - Weight decay: 5e-4
  - Learning rate schedule: Cosine annealing

## Identified Issues
1. Growing train-test accuracy gap (74.93% vs 57.10%) indicating overfitting
2. Basic learning rate schedule might not be optimal
3. Limited data augmentation

## Planned Optimizations

### 1. Enhanced Data Augmentation
- Add RandAugment for stronger augmentation
- Add Cutout augmentation
- Implement MixUp training strategy

### 2. Improved Regularization
- Increase dropout rate (from 0.3 to 0.4)
- Add label smoothing (0.1)
- Stochastic depth regularization

### 3. Learning Rate Schedule Optimization
- Implement gradual warmup (5 epochs)
- Adjust base learning rate to 0.1
- Use One Cycle learning rate schedule
- Add learning rate finder

### 4. Training Process Improvements
- Add gradient clipping (max norm: 1.0)
- Enable automatic mixed precision (AMP)
- Add weight averaging (SWA)

## Implementation Notes
- Created enhanced test script: test_cifar100_enhanced.py
- Added support for experiment tracking
- Improved checkpoint handling with model averaging
